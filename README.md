glitzz
===================


**glitzz** is an IRC bot which is optimized for shitposting and the basic features any IRC channel would likely enjoy.

----------

Getting Started
-------------

If you wanna install this trash:

    $ go get -u github.com/lovelaced/glitzz

There's a makefile. Use it. **BIG SECRET HINT: type "make".**

You'll need a config; luckily for your lazy ass there's a sample one provided. Change it to suit your liking.

	$ glitzz run <path_to_config.json>

You can also run `glitz --help` for help.
